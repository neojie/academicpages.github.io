I received my Ph.D. in geophysics from Yale University in 2019 under the supervision of Kanani Lee . I am currently a post-doctoral scholar working with Lars Stixrude at UCLA. I employ both high-pressure experiments and density functional theory to study

melting and dynamics of Earthâ€™s deep interior 
early evolution of the solar system 
coupled  magma ocean-atmosphere evolution for terrestrial planets and exoplanets
mantle rheology
seismic anisotropy
Recently, I am working on the machine learning aided molecular dynamics simulations to study reactions in large and complicated systems.

Please check my research page for more details.
